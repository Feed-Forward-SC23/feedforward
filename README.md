### This Project has been made targeting these UN Sustainable Goals:

### Description:
* Our solution mainly consists of a Flutter based mobile app. We wanted our solution to reach the masses, that's why we picked flutter as our framework of choice because of its cross-platform capabilities.

* For the backend, we mostly relied on Firebase, for authentication and cloud storage

* For storing the different types of data including user data like responses, results, posts, followers, bio, list of posts etc we have used Firestore database

* For verifying tht user with email & password as well as creating the use we have utilized the authentication feature of Firebase.

* To show realtime location and events near the user's location we are using Google Maps API from GCP.
