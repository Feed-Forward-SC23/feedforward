### This Project has been made targeting these UN Sustainable Goals:

### Description:
Our solution mainly consists of a Flutter based mobile app. We wanted our solution to reach the masses, that's why we picked flutter as our framework of choice because of its cross-platform capabilities.

For the backend, we mostly relied on Firebase, for authentication and cloud storage
